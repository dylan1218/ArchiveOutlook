Set-up:

(1) Define the base folder that you want to archive within the folder variable. Note that ALL emails, within all of the associated subfolders including the base folder will be downloaded. 

(2) Define the path where you want to archive your outlook emails with the downloadpath variable.

(3) run archiveoutlook.py


Note: The console outputs the status of the arhive. The status is relative to the emails that are being downloaded within a folder. Running time will vary depending on the number of emails that you are archiving.
